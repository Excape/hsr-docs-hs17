# Functional Programming Introduction
- Functional Programming means no (or controlled) mutable state and sideeffect-free expressions

## No mutable state
- `f(x)` only depends on the definition of `f` and the value of `x` (Referential Transparency)
- No assignments or control structures

## Functions
- Functions are first-class-citizens, a.k.a. a "primitive" data type
