# First Order Predicate Calculus

## Free and bound variables
- "Input"-Variables = "bound" variables
- They can be freely chosen, except if they are "not free in P", i.e. "not defined inside the scope"

## Proof rules
- \(\frac{H \vdash P}{H \vdash \forall x.P}\) \(\forall\)goal: A predicate can be proven with an arbitrary but fixed value for the variable \(x\)

## Computation with FoPCe
- Error in slide 15: _Is node d reachable from node a?_
